    "description": "# Introduction\nThe Money Transfer Customer Online (aka MTC) REST API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTFul. It has predictable\nresource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also\naccepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use MTC's APIs. \n\nThe API is offered as SaaS platform, that is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted\n\n# Who we are? \n\nGrey Systems is a well establish European IT Consulting company that specialises in working with financial institutions. \n\nDuring the last years, we have developed \"Push Money\"​, a next level technology platform to provide instant online multichannel money transfer services and other financial services and products, outside of conventional banking channels.\n\nOur clients are international MTO's and MNO's that demand solid Fintech expertise for their business operations.\n\nGrey Systems is the best professional IT answer to real time remittance companies.\n\n\n# Goal \n\nThe goal of the API is provide an API for customers to interact with the MTC Systems. This means that the API is intended to by used directly by customers, so all the operations assume that a customer is logged in the system, and will provide information based on that assumption. \n\nThis means that there is no possibility through this MTC Online REST API to query for information at other leven than the customer level, for instance, this API does not offer any method to provide reporting for all customers within a `PartnerSystem`. Please contact GreySystems teams for additional API  \n\n\n# Authentication\n\nAll MTC APIs, including this one, use [OpenId Connect](http://openid.net) protocol to authenticate customers. Specifically the security used is JWT tokens. \n\nAt functional level there are 2 types of tokens: \n\n* **User Token**: Gets an  `access_token` issued on behalf of a customer (end-user), and will identity the customer itself against our API. To get a customer access_token you have to implement the [Authorization Code Flow](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/sso-protocols/oidc.html). \n\n\n\n![alt text](https://rograce.github.io/openid-connect-documentation/images/OIDCAuthCodeFlow.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n\n* **Service Token**: Gets an `access_token` issued to a  non end-user. Very useful for services that calls the API without an user logged in, background processes, etc... To get a Service token you have to implement the [Direct Access Grants](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/sso-protocols/oidc.html), which a REST based worflow to obtain programatically a token without user intervention. \n\n**What kind of token do I have to use**? \n\n* All API methods allow to use a **User Token**\n* `TRANSFER-PAYMENT` methods allow both tokens (user one and service one). However if you call these methods with an **User Token** you will be able to manage only the transfers that belongs to the user of that token. \n\n**How I use the tokens?**\n As stated in the introduction, both tokens types are JWT tokens, and you should set that token in the HTTP `Authorization` Header of the API call in this way: \n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer {the_token}\n```\n\n\n# Common HTTP Error Responses\n\nThe MTC Rest API uses the following common HTTP status codes to communicate general issues or errors to the clients: \n\n* HTTP **401** (Non authorized): The token provided is expired, inexistent or non-valid\n* HTTP **403** (Forbidden): The customer is not allowed to perform the call\n* HTTP **400** (Invalid Request): The request provided is invalid (request is not well formed, a mandatory field is not provided, etc..). \n* HTTP **500** (Internal Server Error): Some internal component has failed to process your request. Please notify about this error to GreySystems team. \n"
